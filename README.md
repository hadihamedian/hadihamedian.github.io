## Why this project exists

Recruiters and engineering leads usually have very limited time to review profiles.

This website aims to:

- Act as a single entry point to my resume, GitHub, and LinkedIn

- Complement my resume with a real, working project

This is **not a marketing website** — it is a professional snapshot.
